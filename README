iprange
By Robert Massaioli (robertmassaioli@gmail.com)

Purpose

   The purpose of this library is to provide a way to add ranges of IP's to an object
   and then retrieve wether or not an IP address is in that range. This project is supposed
   to be robust and be able to handle bad input in nice ways as well as being easily able to
   hande both IPv4 and IPv6 adresses.

Adding to a project

   Currently just make sure that iprange.(cpp|h) are in your include path and say:

      #include <iprange.h>

   Then when you make the class you have to call:

      IPRange<IPV4_t> myRangeObject;

   When you want to add ip adresses:

      // this one example includes every possible range type you can specify
      myRangeObject.add("192.*.[0-10].[100-*]");

   When you want to check is a single IP address is in and range you have added:

      if(myRangeObject.includes("192.168.0.199")) {
         cout << "Hey, it's included!" << endl;
      } else {
         cout << "Dang, it's not." << endl;
      }

   And that's all there is too it.

Technical Details

   The search through the IP adresses is linear; working on making it binary
   search in the near future.
